# Overview

## What is HIPAA?

HIPAA is a U.S. regulation that gives patients greater access to their own medical records and more control over how their personally identifiable health information is used. The regulation also addresses the obligations of healthcare providers and health plans to protect health information.

## What is PHI?

PHI stands for Protected Health Information and it includes data elements that can be used within a data set to identify an individual and disclose their medical records and/or health related financial history.

## What is HIPAA compliance?

In order to be HIPAA compliant, entities such as health care providers or employers that manage PHI, and providers of services to these entities, must ensure that technical, physical and administrative safeguards are in place and adhered to, in order to protect the integrity of PHI. They are also required to follow specific procedures if the integrity of PHI is breached.
