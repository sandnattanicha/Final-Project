## Deidentifying PHI

The PHI deidentification guidance specifies two different approaches:

1. *Expert determination* applies supervised statistical methods to review the data and confirm whether individuals would be identifiable from the data.
1. *Safe harbor* removes all data of the 18 PHI types, thus making re-identification impossible as per HIPAA definition.
